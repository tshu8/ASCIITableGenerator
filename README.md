# ASCIITableGenerator

This is a simple program, intended to be used as a reference for ASCII characters, used in programming, or, anywhere else they may be used.
The program has search abilities, as well as the ability to scroll the characters. 
The search will display the index number which can be used in programming, as well as a brief description of what the character is, or does.
The program was created as a learning tool, during my programming degree at Texas State Technical College - Waco, with help from Dave K.
